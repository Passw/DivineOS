## Build Instructions

Work in progress.

## Background

TempleOS was originally created by Terry A. Davis. Due to his unfortunate passing, he is no longer maintaining this project.\
This repository aims to improve upon the last release by Terry (v5.03 2017 November 20th).\
We will try our best to conform to Terry's original design philosophies while attempting to attract a larger audience through various changes and upgrades.

## Commandments

- Fourteenth commandment: No pedophilia or child porn.
- Fifteenth commandment:  Don't eat rare meat with blood.
- Sixteenth commandment:  No wife beating.
- Seventeen commandment:  Do not swing from radio towers with one hand.
- Eighteenth commandment: Do not disturb.

## Additional Information

TempleOS is a 64 bit, non-preemptive multi-tasking, multi-cored, public domain, open source, ring-0-only, single address space, non-networked, PC operating system for recreational programming. The OS runs 8-bit ASCII with graphics in source code and has a 2D and 3D graphics library, which run at 640x480 VGA with 16 colors. Like most modern operating systems, it has keyboard and mouse support. It supports ISO 9660, FAT32 and RedSea file systems (the latter created by Davis) with support for file compression. Many of these specifications—such as the 640x480 resolution, 16 color display, and single audio voice—were instructed to him by God. It also included an original flight simulator, compiler, and kernel.

## TODO

* [ ] Add build instructions
* [ ] Add supplementary discs
* [ ] Create a dedicated webite to host the code in RedSea format, with an online code viewer (this might require a modified git or svn to enable creating diffs for RedSea format)
