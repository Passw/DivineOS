LiteUnzip.cpp was made by Alan. It can decompress an entire folder. Audio, Image, and Video decompression were stripped.
TOSZ.cpp was made by Terry. It decompresses 1 file at a time.

To compile, run: make
To clean, run: make c

These are only tested under Linux but should work for any POSIX compatible operating systems.
